# PhotoScrapBook
PhotoScrapBook is a CloudKit morning stretch problem to get students acquainted with SFSafariViewController, UIImagePickerController &amp; CloudKit. The goal is to open a safari web page and download an image which will then get posted and retrieved from CloudKit showing the user a list of images they have saved to cloud kit upon viewing the main view.
